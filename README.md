# MM1-Queue-simulator
Queueing theory is the mathematical study of waiting lines, or queues.[1] In queueing theory, a model is constructed so that queue lengths and waiting time can be predicted. an M/M/1 queue represents the queue length in a system having a single server, where arrivals are determined by Poisson process and job service times have an exponential distribution. The model name is written in Kendall’s notation. The model is the most elementary of queueing models[1] and an attractive object of study as closed form expressions can be obtained for many metrics of interest in this model. In this paper, I analyzed the performance measures of M/M/1 queueing system by conducting various experiments to evaluate the correctness of the simulated results. This has been achieved by observing the results generated from the simulation, with the results obtained from the theoretical formula.

Steps to reproduce
1. Just run the mm1.py (python mm1.py)
2. You will get two csv files in your poject directory
3. make sure you give correct arrival rates and sevice time inorder to reproduce satisfactory results.
